Description

We want to create something affordable to transform the way small businesses and shop owners can invoice their customers and retrieve inventory from their online stores.


Motivation

Based in the experience of the team we found that Small businesses and even people with small stores physical or online don’t have the opportunity to purchase a solution for their inventory and most important to create invoices.

Ignacio from our team faces this problem daily at work, the invoice process consumes people time to have a solution like this will increase exponentially the productivity and the accuracy of the inventories.

This is not a one customer problem, the owners of online stores face the same problem of not being able to invoice the end customer


Result

The result is a user-friendly interface to create and send invoices using InvoiceOcean API, for the inventory we query Walmart and ETSY API. For the purpose of demonstration at this point we query by a key word to the general store, but the production solution will query the customer store. 

All the results get stored in firebase in this way the customer can manage their inventory with data persistence to avoid inventory mistakes.

When the user adds a product, it reflects on the invoice so they can add it easily to the invoice.


Team Efforts

Alex – Authentication API, research about APIs.

Daniel – Responsible for the final UI and ETSY API to show capabilities

Ignacio – Coordinate the project, Invoice API as the core of this project.



Challenges

The research of APIs was among the hardest challenges, we test and research for many invoice API and online stores API to retrieve inventories. 

Work together as a team was also a challenge since we all have work activities, tight schedules, etc. 


Improvements

•	Add more APIs for online stores.
•	Tools that allows to add inventory manually
•	Improve and make it more appealing
